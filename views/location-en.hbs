  <h2>Getting around</h2>
  <p>
    It’s super easy to get around Queenstown on foot, but if you plan to do activities in or around the region, travelling by car will be easiest. Many tour operators will, however, make arrangements to
    pick you up at your accommodation or nearby if you don’t have transport (may cost extra, make inquires at time of booking).
    It is easiest to fly direct to Queenstown, and there are multiple flights daily from across New Zealand.
    Queenstown is approximately 7 hours (486km) from Christchurch and 4.5 hours (283km) from Dunedin. For more tips on driving from Christchurch, see http://www.newzealandtravelinsider.com/scenic-drives/drive-from-christchurch-to-queenstown-driving-times-new-zealand.htm.

N.B. Some activities – especially flights – are weather dependent. If you book ahead of time, operators will advise whether the activity will go ahead with 24 hours or less notice.
They should reschedule for you if the weather’s not favourable; but you must check this when you book. It’s wise to give yourself some flexibility with these types of events in case they need to be rescheduled.
As with any activities, there will be risks, so make sure you check out safety procedures and the operators before you book.
