    <h1>Getting there</h1>
      <p>The nearest airport is Queenstown (ZQN) and sadly, there are no direct flights from Europe: you will either have to change
        plane in New-Zealand (Christchurch or Auckland)or somewhere in Australia (Sydney is only 3 hours flight away).</p>

        <p>Wanaka is 1 hour away from Queenstown, so if you want to visit the area, it is recommended that you book a car. </p>

        <p>Some advice:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Try to book as early as you can (tickets are on sale 1 year before). In the UK, Flightcenter offers very good deals.</li>
          <li>Most of the times, the fastest routes is not the cheapest! We found that if you take tickets with connections in
            Australia, you could save £500 than if you were flying directly.</li>
          <li>Stay overnight in Singapore, it will be a longer trip but you will feel much better than flying directly!</li>
          <li>If there's a group of you, try to book group tickets - you might get a discount!</li>
          <li>If you can, do not book your tickets for an arrival between Dec 11th and Dec 26th - the tickets will be very expensive because
           of Christmas.</li>
        </ul>

      <h1>Accomodation</h1>

        <p>Queenstown offers a wide range of accommodation options. However, you should
        consider booking as soon as possible, as January is high summer in New Zealand, and
        Queenstown hosts numerous events and festivals over New Year’s Eve.</p>

        <p>Also note that Queenstown is very hilly, so be aware that you may have to walk up
        and down hills or steps if you are out of the immediate city centre!</p>
